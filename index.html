                <h2>MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS</h2>
                    <P>
            There are various methods for managing mental health problems. Treatment is highly individual, and what works for one person may not work for another. <br>
            <br>
            Treatments include; <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Psychotherapists, or talking theerapists</h3>
            <p>This type of treatment takes a psychological approach or treating illness. Congnitive behavioral therapy, exposure therapy and dialectal behaviour therapy are  examples. <br>
                <br>
                Psychiatrists, psychologist, psychotherapists and some primary care physicians carry out this type of treatment. It can help people understand the root of their mental illness and start to work on more healthful thought patterns that support everyday living and reduce the risk of isolation.
            </p>
            <h3>Medication</h3>
            <p>
                Some people take prescribed medications, such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and anxiotic drugs. Although these canâ€™t cure mental disorders, some medications can improve symptoms and help a person resume social interractions and a normal routine while they work on their mental health.
            </p>
            <h3>Self  help</h3>
            <p>
            A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to make changes to their lifestyle to facilitate wellness.
            Such changes might include reducing alcohol intake, sleeping more, and eaing a balanced nutritious diet. People may take time away from work or resolve issues with personal relationships that may be causing damage to their mental health. People with conditions such as anxiety or depressive disorder may benefit from relaxation techniques, wich include deep breathing, meditation and mindfulness.
